## Breast Cancer Patients Survival Prediction With Machine Learning Models

I add Support Vector Machine model. When I use it to predict the survival of breast cancer patient. There is no improvement in accuracy with clinical data set; however, it shows the improvement in accuracy score when I test with expression data and combined dataset.

I did not update my presentaion power point but I upload the fixed version of jupyter notebook.
